# Prayer-Times
A simple web app that displays daily prayer times based on the user's current location. It automatically detects your position using the browserâ€™s Geolocation API and fetches accurate prayer timings from a public API. The app also includes a clean UI, real-time countdown for the next prayer, and light/dark mode toggle for better usability.
